# google-calendar-copy
Import events from one Google calendar to another.

### Overview
This script imports events from one calander (external) into another (primary).
Update the "settings" found below to make any changes you need.
This does not copy all-day events, but it does work with recurring events.
It will also update events that have changed and delete events that no longer exist.

It uses to Google Calander GSuite Service found here:
  https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/calendar/

### Installation and Setup
Here is a good description of how to get a script like this working.
I think this script has some good improvements over the one at this link, but the process is the same.
